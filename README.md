Description:
Glamout Beauty is a responsive, static site which allows users to view details regarding the business and schedule an appointment directly from the site. 

Tools Used:
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

You can access this project live at https://www.glamourb.netlify.app. I hope you enjoy!

Optimizations:
I plan to later optimize this site by adding building out the backend component for scheduling appointments, storing data, and sending reminder emails for upcoming appointments to prospective customers.
